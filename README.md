* ## Wireframes

The original concept was fluid and gradually took shape after the project inception and first example of a wireframe. 
The wireframe for the index page initially had a different layout and as the project grew and different options were tried 
these were updated to better fit the improved design. The original wireframe for the home page is below, followed by the updated
wireframes for the current design of the site.
